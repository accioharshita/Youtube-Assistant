![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*TpyOMCoo0QC86Qcb9Q0aUg.png)

- This is a simple Youtube Assistant, which takes `URL` of any youtube video, along with the `questions` about the video as the input from the user and gives the best possible answer.

- You can save so much time by simply asking the model the right questions, the perfect personal assistant for busy days.

- This web application is built using [`LangChain`](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) and [`Open AI`](https://platform.openai.com/) api (Chat GPT as the large language model)

## Setting up .env file in your working directory

- This file will contain your secret API key which you can use in the project.
- Assuming that you've generated your API key, create a new .env file and paste the link there.

```
openai_api_key= "YOUR SECRET KEY"

```

- After that you can refer the code and the requirements.txt file. Happy creating :)
